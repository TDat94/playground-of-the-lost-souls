        I grew up in Da Nang city, Vietnam, so I&apos;m as Vietnamese as it
        gets. I moved to Ho Chi Minh city initially for University, but I ended
        up finding a job and will probably spend even more time here than I have
        in Da Nang. I will soon graduate from University of Science, VNU-HCM
        with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Technology. My original
        plan was to become a software developer, but during my study at
        university, I realized I was more interested in messing with completed
        software projects than building new ones, so I am now focusing on
        software testing and quality assurance. I am excited to see where my
        career will take me in the future.
